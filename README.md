# PIR-Sensor
Semester III Project 

Development of a PIR sensor using analog circuit parts only. Circuitry was so that the PIR sensor could detect, IR emitting objects moving in a field of view of at least 120Â° cone angle and at least within 5 meters from the sensor. The delay time, trigger mode, non-trigger mode and sensitivity to daylight was adjustable.
